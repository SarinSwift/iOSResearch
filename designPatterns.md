## Design Patterns
Design patterns are used to represent many best practices adapted by object oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences.     
There are ***3 main types of software design patterns***
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioral

### Creational
Deals with object creation mechanisms. They try to instantiate objects up to the right situation.  
***Example of creational design patterns:***
1. Factory Method
2. Abstract Factory
3. Builder
4. Singleton
5. Prototype

### Structural
They aim to simplify design by finding the easy way to realize relationships between classes and objects.  
***Examples of structural design pattern:***
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Facade
4. Decorator
5. Composite
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy


### Behavioral    
Identifies common communication patterns between entities and then implement these patterns.  
***Examples of behavioral design patterns:***
1. Observer
2. Chain of Responsibility
3. Template Method
4. Command
5. Iterator
6. Mediator
7. Memento
8. Strategy
9. State
10. Visitor


### Most Common Used Design Patterns
Design patterns can be incredibly useful if used in the right situations. They also provide a common language to conceptualize repeated problems and solutions. And here we'll look in to the most common design patterns - When to apply them, and an example use case.
